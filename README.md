# About Me

1. I am a student studying web development, born on July 30, 2004, and my hobby is gaming.

2. The main languages available are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can also use C++ and C#, though only a little.

3. I can also use Photoshop, Illustrator, and figma, although at a student level.

4. Finally, here is my X account. [here][(https://zenn.dev/manase](https://x.com/toda_naopi?t=3ZzRtNS4oatmSD-CbzGzbw&s=09))
